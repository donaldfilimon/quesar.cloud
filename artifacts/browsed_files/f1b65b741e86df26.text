# Quasar

Quasar lives at `apps/quasar/` inside the MLAI integration repository. Its
service, shared package and Expo app are members of the repository's root Bun
workspace and are locked by the root `bun.lock` (isolated linker); install
from the repository root. `templates/next-site` is outside that workspace and
keeps its own lockfile. From the repository root, `bun run check:quasar` runs
its native type, unit, and Expo export gates.

Quasar is an AI website builder: describe a site in a prompt, Claude scaffolds
and writes a real **Next.js 16 App Router** project, and you preview it live
on your own machine. **v1** is intentionally small — a local Bun service plus
an Expo app that drives it. There is no deploy step yet; "preview" means
`next dev` running on your Mac.

Quasar is the first slice of a larger, staged plan (see the design spec) —
deploy adapters, hosting, auth, and a templates gallery are explicitly out of
scope here.

## Architecture

Four parts; the first two and the Expo app are root workspace members, the
template is copied, not installed in place:

```
packages/shared      TypeScript types + zod schemas shared by service and app
                      (Site, GenerationEvent, PreviewStatus, request bodies)
packages/service      local Bun service (Bun.serve, default port 4700):
                      registry, path guard, site filesystem tools, the
                      generation engine, the scaffolder, and the preview
                      manager
templates/next-site   a buildable, checked-in minimal Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4
                      starter — copied per-site as the generation baseline
apps/quasar           Expo SDK 53 / React 19 / Expo Router app (web + iOS +
                      Android): sites list, new-site form, live generation
                      feed + preview, settings
```

**Data flow:**

1. The app POSTs `{name, prompt}` to `/api/sites`. The service reserves a
   registry slot, copies `templates/next-site` into
   `~/.quasar/sites/<slug>/`, and starts a generation job.
2. The generation engine (`packages/service/src/engine.ts`) drives the
   Anthropic SDK's Tool Runner against three tools — `list_files`,
   `read_file`, `write_file` — all path-guarded so writes can never escape
   the site directory. Every tool call and text delta is pushed onto a
   per-site in-memory event buffer.
3. The app polls `GET /api/sites/:id/events?since=N` to render the feed. The
   design spec specifies this as an SSE stream with events buffered per job
   so a late-attaching client can catch up; v1 implements that same buffered
   catch-up semantics as a JSON cursor the client polls (`?since=N` →
   `{events, next}`) rather than an actual `EventSource`/SSE connection —
   pure SSE framing is deferred.
4. `POST /api/sites/:id/preview/start` spawns `next dev` for that site on an
   allocated port (4710+), health-checks it by polling `http://localhost:<port>/`
   for a 200, and returns a status with the URL; the app rewrites `localhost`
   to the Settings-configured host (so it resolves correctly from a phone on
   the LAN) before displaying the URL and opening it — in an iframe (web) or
   via `Linking` (native).
5. Data lives entirely on disk under `~/.quasar/` (a registry JSON file plus
   one real, editor-openable Next.js project per site) and in the Anthropic
   account behind whatever credential the service resolves. There is no
   database and no Quasar-hosted backend.

Each site directory is a normal Next.js project — open it in an editor,
`git init` it, run its own `bun run dev` — Quasar's service is just the thing
that wrote it and that you use for the driven experience.

## How to run

```bash
bun install    # from the repository root
```

**Start the service** (needs Anthropic credentials — either set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment or run `ant auth login` first; the
service never stores or proxies a key of its own):

```bash
bun run --filter '@quasar/service' start
```

This serves on `http://localhost:4700` by default (`PORT` overrides it) and
binds to `0.0.0.0`, so it's reachable from other devices on the same LAN.
Site data and the registry live under `~/.quasar` (`QUASAR_HOME` overrides
this).

**Start the app** (dev, web target), from the repository root:

```bash
cd apps/quasar/apps/quasar && bun run web
```

(`bun run dev:quasar` from the repository root starts the same app with
`expo start`. `apps/quasar` itself has no `web` script.)

Or build a static export from that same directory: `bunx expo export --platform web`.

**Reaching the service from a phone:** the app defaults its base URL to
`http://localhost:4700`, which only works when the app and service share a
loopback interface (i.e. the web target on the same machine as the service).
To drive the service from an iOS/Android device, find your Mac's LAN IP
(`ipconfig getifaddr en0` or similar) and enter
`http://<that-ip>:4700` in the app's **Settings** screen. That origin is saved on this device using AsyncStorage and hydrated before
the first request. Only HTTP(S) origins are accepted; credentials, paths,
queries and fragments are rejected. **Save and test connection** reads
`GET /api/sites` without creating or changing sites.

## Connection recovery

Requests time out after 15 seconds; preview startup allows 120 seconds. On a
connection error, use **Retry / refresh state** or **Open settings**. Retry reads
current state and never resends a create, edit, preview, or delete action. A
failed mutation can have reached the service: further mutations are blocked
until a successful explicit refresh. For creation, Retry returns to the sites
list so you can check whether the site was created before submitting again.
Generation status and preview process status are displayed separately.

Polling retains its event cursor while disconnected and drains completed jobs
on reconnect. Changing the saved origin cancels requests, discards old results,
and clears the site and event state. The origin is ordinary device storage;
Anthropic credentials remain exclusively on the service side.

## Manual acceptance flow

This is what "it works end to end" means for v1; run it after any change
that touches the service or app:

1. Start the service and the app.
2. On the sites list, create a new site with a name and a prompt.
3. Watch the live generation feed on the site's detail screen (text
   narration + a file-write ticker) until it reaches `done`.
4. Start the preview and open it — web shows it in an iframe, native opens it
   via the device's browser.
5. Submit an edit prompt (disabled while a job is already running) and watch
   the second job stream.
6. Reload the preview and confirm the edit is visible.

## v1 status and limitations

**Verified by this build:** `bun install`, `bun run typecheck` (all three
TypeScript workspaces), `bun run test` (60 `bun:test` cases across 10 files —
path guard, site filesystem tools (including the read-side size cap),
registry atomicity, port allocation, event buffering, scaffold, preview
manager, HTTP routing, a mocked-client engine test, a typed-error-mapping
unit test, and two streaming regression tests that point a real `Anthropic`
client at local `Bun.serve` stubs — one asserting the request actually
leaves the client over SSE, one asserting a 429 stub maps end-to-end to the
rate-limit message; the preview-manager tests do spawn real local processes
and poll `localhost`, and the streaming regression tests spawn local HTTP
stubs, but nothing in the suite calls the Anthropic API or needs
credentials), and `bunx expo export --platform web` for `apps/quasar` all
pass clean as of this task. (Re-measured 2026-09-17 in the monorepo: `bun test packages`
from `apps/quasar` runs 69 cases across 11 files, including `packages/shared`, exit 0.
Run one file with `bun test packages/service/src/paths.test.ts`.)

**Not exercised in this build environment:** a real end-to-end generation
run against the live Anthropic API. The engine's tool loop, path guard, and
error mapping are unit-tested against a mocked client (and, for the
streaming wire format, a local stub server), but no run in this environment
has held a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ant auth login` session to actually
call Claude, scaffold a real prompt, and preview the result. The manual
acceptance flow above is the way to close that gap on a machine that has
credentials configured.

**Known v1 constraints, by design:**

- **Local-only.** No deploy targets or hosting — "preview" is `next dev` on
  your machine. Closing your laptop stops every preview.
- **No database.** State is a JSON registry file plus one directory per site
  on disk; there's no multi-user or remote sync story.
- **Events are polling, not push.** The design spec called for an SSE
  stream; v1 ships the same buffered-catch-up semantics as a JSON cursor the
  app polls (`GET /api/sites/:id/events?since=N`) instead — see "Data flow"
  above. Pure SSE framing is deferred, not abandoned.
- **One generation job per site at a time** — an edit while a job is running
  gets a 409.
- **No auth, no multi-user, no billing** — anyone who can reach the service's
  port (loopback, or your LAN if you've shared the IP) can drive it.
- **CORS is wide open (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)** — this is a wider
  hole than "any LAN peer": since there's no origin check, any webpage open
  in a browser on the LAN (not just a device or person you trust) can drive
  the service via a cross-origin `fetch` from that page's own JavaScript.
- **Every listener is on all interfaces, on purpose.** The service
  (`Bun.serve` with no hostname, default port 4700) and each site preview
  (`next dev`, ports 4710 and up) listen on every interface, which is what
  lets a phone on the LAN reach them. Measured 2026-09-17: the service
  reported `TCP *:4798`, and a Next 16 `next dev` preview reported
  `TCP *:3917` plus a LAN network URL. Run Quasar only on a network you
  trust, and stop it when you are done.

## Repeatable isolated journey acceptance

After `bun run check:quasar` from the integration root, run from this workspace:

```bash
bun scripts/verify-journeys.ts --output /absolute/new-revision-receipt.json
```

The verifier requires the existing Playwright 1.63.0 tooling in the sibling
`apps/quasar-web/.ds-sync` environment and its Chromium installation. It does not install
browser tooling silently. It serves the exported Expo app, copies the real Next
template, requires a frozen install, and uses disposable service/data directories
and available ports. It tests connection persistence, origin switching, preview
restart and a committed create whose response is lost. Each output filename must
be new; receipts and screenshots from failures remain available. The generator is
a synthetic fixture. Live Anthropic acceptance still requires separate credentials.
