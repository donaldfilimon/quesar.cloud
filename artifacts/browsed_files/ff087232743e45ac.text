# Quesar — mobile

This app lives at `apps/mobile/` in the Quesar integration repository. Run its
commands here, or use the root `bun run check:mobile` gate. The website and
Quasar are sibling applications with independent validation boundaries.

An Expo + React 19 mobile app for Quesar, powered by Bun and written entirely in
TypeScript / TSX. A modern, reactive companion to the web site: file-based
routing, Reanimated motion, gradient masking, haptic press feedback, and the
same chip-stack identity.

## Run it

```bash
(cd ../.. && bun install)   # one root workspace and bun.lock
bun start            # Expo dev server → scan the QR with Expo Go
# or target a platform directly:
bun run ios          # iOS simulator (macOS)
bun run android      # Android emulator
bun run web          # react-native-web in the browser
```

Verify at any time:

```bash
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit, strict
bun run test         # jest (jest-expo) — pure-logic unit suites
bun run lint         # eslint (eslint-config-expo)
```

> **Staying current.** The dependency set is pinned to the Expo SDK 53 family —

> `bunx expo install expo@latest --fix`.

```

## What makes it reactive

- **Reanimated entering animations** — sections fade-and-rise on mount; honors
  the OS reduce-motion setting automatically.
- **Spring press feedback** — every card and button scales on press and fires a
  light haptic (`PressableScale`).
- **Evidence strip** — the hero names source-backed HNSW/MVCC and CPU-oracle
  accelerator parity without publishing uncorroborated performance figures.
- **Gradient masking** — the hero accent is real gradient-filled text on native
  (`MaskedView` + `LinearGradient`).
- **Native feel** — iOS blur tab bar, edge-to-edge, dark system UI.

## iCloud sign-in + CloudKit backend

Sign in with Apple gates the app, and what a user saves is written to **their
own private CloudKit database** — there is no MLAI server in the path.

```
expo-apple-authentication   Sign in with Apple (iCloud identity)
expo-secure-store           keychain persistence of the session + local fallback
modules/mlai-cloudkit/      native Swift module → CKContainer.privateCloudDatabase
plugins/withCloudKit.js     config plugin: iCloud + CloudKit entitlements
lib/auth.tsx                AuthProvider / useAuth, credential-revocation check
lib/cloud.ts                vault repository (CloudKit ⇢ encrypted-local fallback)
app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx      branded sign-in
app/(tabs)/vault.tsx        the CloudKit-backed feature — create, inline-edit,
                            delete, and search notes in your iCloud
app/account.tsx             identity · storage status · sign out
```

### What runs where

| Surface            | Sign in with Apple | CloudKit private DB |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Dev build / TestFlight (iOS)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| Expo Go (iOS)      | ✅ | ⛔ → encrypted-local fallback |
| Web / Android      | ⛔ → preview session | ⛔ → encrypted-local fallback |

The data layer detects the native module (`requireOptionalNativeModule`) and
falls back to an encrypted on-device store when it's absent, surfacing the
active backend in the Vault banner and Account screen. So the app runs
everywhere; **real iCloud sync requires a dev build** (the Swift module is
compiled, the entitlements are applied).

### One-time native setup

1. **Apple Developer** — in the App ID for `dev.mlai.mobile`, enable
   *Sign in with Apple* and *iCloud (CloudKit)*; create the container
   `iCloud.dev.mlai.mobile`.
2. **CloudKit Dashboard** (Development env) — create record type `VaultItem`:
   - `title` — String
   - `body` — String
   - `createdAt` — Double *(mark **Sortable** + **Queryable** so the newest-first
     query works; also keep `recordName` Queryable, which is the default)*
3. **Build it natively** (not Expo Go):

```bash
bunx expo prebuild --clean      # generates ios/ with entitlements via the plugin
bunx expo run:ios               # local dev build on a device/simulator
# or, cloud build:
bunx eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

> The plugin writes the iCloud container, `com.apple.developer.icloud-services`,
> and the `remote-notification` background mode (reserved for future CloudKit
> subscription pushes). `aps-environment` defaults to `development`.

### Verification status (this feature)

- `tsc --noEmit` — **clean** with the auth + CloudKit code included.
- `expo export --platform web` — **succeeds**; 16 routes bundle, the auth gate
  redirects protected routes, and the optional-native-module fallback resolves.
- The **Swift module was not compiled** and **CloudKit was not exercised** in the
  build environment — that requires an Apple-signed dev build on a device with an
  iCloud account. The Swift, entitlements, and schema are written to spec.



## Integrity rules (same as the web)

- Every metric carries provenance — **● measured · ○ target · ◆ reported** — and
  the three are never conflated. A target is never shown as a result.
- The only Apple framing used anywhere is:
  *"Built on Apple's public frameworks — Metal, Accelerate, Core ML."*
- The open core is **Apache-2.0**.

## Verification status

- `tsc --noEmit` (strict) — **clean**, against real Expo SDK 53 / RN 0.79 types.
- `bun run test` (jest-expo) — **passing**; pure-logic suites cover the vault
  repository (add/update/delete/search helpers, local fallback) and the brand /
  theme / auth helpers.
- `bun run lint` (eslint-config-expo) — **clean**, 0 problems.
- `expo export --platform web` — **succeeds**; all 16 routes bundle and
  statically render (home, the four tab sections, `vault`, `account`, `sign-in`,
  `product/[slug]`, and the 404).
- A native iOS/Android simulator was not run in the build environment, so the
  final visual pass is yours: `bun run ios` / `bun run android`. On native, the
  gradient hero text and iOS blur render fully (react-native-web approximates
  both).

### Vault recovery

The encrypted local vault retains the existing `mlai.vault.local.v1` key and
JSON array format. Only a missing SecureStore record is an empty vault. Read
failures, malformed JSON, invalid records (including duplicate identifiers), and
write failures surface explicit errors. Reads and mutations never reset or
replace corrupt data; recovery requires restoring valid storage externally and
retrying. Error messages do not include stored note contents.

Local add, edit, and delete operations validate the stored records and serialize
the complete read/modify/write operation within one JavaScript runtime.
SecureStore has no cross-process compare-and-swap primitive; this queue does not
coordinate multiple app processes. The native CloudKit path remains separate:
a native error never switches to local storage. An available iCloud account is
reported as account availability, not proof of synchronization.

Failed refreshes retain visible notes and unsaved drafts. Use **Retry load** to
read again, or retry the existing Save, Update, or Delete action after a write
failure. Successful refreshes and search keep an active edit draft reachable,
even if the record is absent from the refreshed list. An update to a missing
local record fails explicitly and retains that draft. Older refresh responses
cannot overwrite newer successful edits. These recovery tests exercise mocked
storage; signed-device CloudKit acceptance remains a separate gate.
