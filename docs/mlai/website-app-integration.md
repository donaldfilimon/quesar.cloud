# Website application integration — 2026-09-08

Current four-app journey delivery: [delivery ledger](four-app-journeys.md).

Current hardening, reproducible commands and acceptance evidence are in the
[integration completion record](integration-hardening.md). The import details
below are historical provenance.

The local `mlai-website-app` main history through `d988a218efe747f2adf1ee073ec72ee249d69d76` is
merged into this repository under `apps/website-app`. The import also includes
its current uncommitted source, local lifecycle documentation, research receipts
and screenshots. The source checkout was retained at import time. Its later
history (through `801bdad`) was merged here on 2026-09-16, the checkout moved to
`~/dev/archive/mlai-website-app-merged-20260916`, and the
`donaldfilimon/mlai-website-app` repository was archived read-only on GitHub;
`apps/website-app` is now the only place to develop the app.
The [source manifest](website-app-import-manifest.json) records all 284 imported
file hashes and the files adapted for integration. Ignored private databases,
credentials, documents, model weights, environments and build outputs were not copied.

## Architecture and commands

`apps/quasar-web` remains the canonical production website. `apps/website-app` retains
its independent Next.js runtime, SQLite/Better Auth, shared UI package, Python
worker and non-deployable Eve scaffold. Their authentication, data stores and
public routes remain distinct. This is a repository integration, not a runtime
migration or a deployment change. **Superseded 2026-09-22:** the runtime migration into one app is now the plan (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-22-single-app-merge-design.md`); this text stays as history.

Root `install:all`, `check`, `check:website-app`, `dev:website-app` and the topology
gate include the imported app. Since 2026-09-16 its JavaScript dependencies are
locked by the repository's root `bun.lock` (one root workspace, isolated
linker); its Python worker keeps `worker/uv.lock`.
Root CI has a website-app job with Node 24, Bun 1.4.2, a frozen root install, TypeScript,
formatting, research verification, unit tests, serial database migration and build.
The nested source workflow is retained for provenance; GitHub runs the root job.

The research verifier now streams large Git diffs into SHA-256 instead of using
a fixed output buffer, and scopes dirty-state detection to the application.
A regression test covers a diff over 1 MiB, sibling isolation and Git failure.
Playwright accepts `MLAI_E2E_PORT` to validate the imported app while another
checkout uses the default 3101; it still refuses to reuse an existing server.

## Validation from the integrated checkout

Local runtime: Bun 1.4.3 canary, Node 26.8.1, Python 3.13.14.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Root topology | Passed, 14 required paths |
| Existing web | Full check passed, 43 files / 391 tests and Next build |
| Existing mobile | Full check passed, 7 suites / 41 tests and Expo web export |
| Existing Quasar | Full check passed, 60 tests and Expo web export |
| Imported app frozen install | Passed without lockfile changes |
| Imported app setup | Passed, all 23 advertised document formats verified |
| Imported app full root gate | Passed, TypeScript/UI, 12 files / 107 tests, 26 parser tests, production build |
| Imported app formatting | Passed |
| Imported research evidence | Passed, 6 topics, 21 publications, 7 studies, 4 attachments |
| Public browser acceptance | Passed in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit at 320, 390, 768 and 1440 px |

Setup and the full gate used an isolated synthetic data directory at
`/tmp/mlai-website-import-validation`. Browser validation used port 3111 and
UUID-isolated synthetic data/build directories. Private source-checkout state
was not used. Research tests verified keyboard navigation, search persistence,
clear-button focus, narrow reflow, PDF downloads and absence of page errors.

The pre-existing edit to `apps/quasar-web/scripts/crawl-links.mjs` was preserved outside
the merge commit. Hosted CI, Node 24 execution, public deployment, the complete
authenticated browser suite and live ABI/WDBX/model integration were not run for
this import. Historical receipts carried from the source are not new acceptance
proof for this checkout. No source checkout, branch or worktree was deleted.

## Follow-up merge — 2026-09-16

The standalone repository kept moving after the import. Its twelve commits from
`d988a218` to `801bdad` (research release evidence, verification process-group
cleanup, footer contrast, and the Quesar pilot call to action) were brought in
with `git merge -X subtree=apps/website-app`. Because `1b3e2b3` already made
`d988a218` an ancestor, that is the merge base, and the twelve commits keep their
original hashes in this history.

Four files needed hand resolution:

- `scripts/verify-clean-install.ts`: kept this repository's
  `writeVerificationReceipt` and the source's move of `execFileSync` into
  `verification-command.ts`. `writeFileSync` is no longer imported.
- `CLAUDE.md`: kept the monorepo wording, which already carried the source's
  changes plus the root CI and `MLAI_E2E_PORT` context.
- `docs/LOCAL-LIFECYCLE.md`: kept the monorepo text and added the source's
  serial-gate warning, `--site-revision` pinning and clean-install
  model-selection notes.
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`: kept both, with the source's completion section
  labelled as standalone history.

`docs/website-app-import-manifest.json` is left unchanged. It remains the
provenance record of the 2026-09-08 import, not a manifest of the current tree.
The standalone checkout and its GitHub repository were not modified.
