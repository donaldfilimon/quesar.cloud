/**
 * Ported from `vendor/mlai-review/lib/content.ts`'s `projects[]` (task 4 of
 * the vendor-reconciliation plan —
 * `.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-07-vendor-reconciliation/task-4-brief.md`). The
 * vendored `id` is renamed `slug`; every other field is carried verbatim
 * (curly apostrophes included) with three exceptions:
 *
 * Ruling A — `docsHref`: the vendored `docs` field was a bare article slug.
 * `abbey`/`gama` ported cleanly to `/docs/identity` and `/docs/gama`, but
 * `abi`/`wdbx` pointed at slugs (`runtime`, `wdbx`) this app never ported as
 * standalone doc routes — the existing `/docs` page already covers both
 * subjects (see `src/data/categories/docs-nav.ts`, whose `docNav` ids are
 * exactly `runtime` and `wdbx`). Those two resolve to the `/docs` page's own
 * anchors instead of a dead `/docs/<slug>` link.
 *
 * Ruling B — `source`: the vendored `source` field was a key into a separate
 * `sources` lookup map (`vendor/mlai-review/lib/content.ts`'s `sources`).
 * Resolved and inlined here as `{ title, url }` rather than porting a second
 * module. The docs corpus resolves the same vendored map — see `DOC_SOURCES`
 * in `docs.ts` — so both surfaces now render real links; an earlier version of
 * this comment described the docs sources as unlinkable bare strings, which
 * stopped being true when that map was ported.
 *
 * Ruling C — `wdbx.limit`: the vendored text read "This website is not a
 * connected database and shows no live retrieval results," written about
 * the vendored review site and false when published on MLAI's own site.
 * Rewritten below to keep the disclaimer's substance without the
 * review-site framing. The other three `limit` fields are verbatim.
