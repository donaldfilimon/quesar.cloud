/**
 * Read a capped JSON body, or the `Response` the handler should return.
 *
 * Every JSON route wants the same four outcomes — over the cap → 413,
 * unparseable → 400, parseable but not a JSON *object* → 400, otherwise the
 * parsed value — so that contract lives here once instead of being restated at
 * each call site. Callers narrow with a single `instanceof Response` check;
 * `JSON.parse` can never yield a `Response`, so the union is unambiguous.
 *
 * The object-shape check is load-bearing, not cosmetic. `null`, `5`, `"str"`,
 * `true` and `[]` are all *valid* JSON, so without it they sail past the parse
 * and past the caller's `instanceof Response` narrowing, and the first
 * `body.field` access throws — which happens OUTSIDE each route's try/catch,
 * so the 400 the route intended escaped as a 500. On `/api/inquiries` and
 * `/api/telemetry` that was an unauthenticated 500 (and on telemetry it broke
 * that handler's own "always 204" invariant).
 *
 * So the contract `T` carries is now split in two:
 *   - SHAPE is guaranteed. The value is a non-null, non-array object, so
 *     property access on it is safe.
 *   - FIELDS are still an assertion, not a validation. Nothing here inspects
 *     them, which is why routes keep their own per-field checks (see
 *     `TELEMETRY_EVENTS`, or the inquiry length checks) and why callers should
 *     declare `T` with `unknown`-typed fields.
 *
 * A top-level array is rejected with the rest because no `readJsonLimited`
 * caller wants one. The one route that legitimately accepts an array body —
 * `/api/csp-report`, for the Reporting API batch format — reads raw text
 * through `readBodyLimited` and never comes through here.
